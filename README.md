I built this site using React, as I'm a big fan of how simple the components are to build and work with.

The site as a whole just renders individual components when the corresponding navbar item is clicked as opposed to opening a whole new page.

Thought I'd keep it rather minimalist, as a sort of homage to [the GOAT](https://motherfuckingwebsite.com/).
